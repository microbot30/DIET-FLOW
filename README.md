# DIET-FLOW
Due to the improvement in people's standards of living, Obesity rates are increasing at an alarming speed, and this is reflective of the risks in people's health. People need to control their daily calorie intake by eating healthier foods. But due to our busy schedule, we lose track of our daily diets and often take the wrong food.  The hard-times of following the diets is now over, we have developed a mobile application that acts as a personal companion who keeps track of our daily diets for us. Our app is tuned in such a way that it learns the user's taste and preference to recommend the right food with the right caloric content. We use Augmented Reality(AR) and our Deep Learning algorithm to increase the accuracy of food classification and predict the number of calories present in the food. This enhances the User Experience by making the user interact with our app in a fun manner. Data Science plays a crucial role in our app. Using Data Science we keep track of the User's daily food intake and represent the collected data in a graphical manner(Data Visualization). Users can also post their progress and achievements in social media platforms(Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc.). we are using Bitmojis to enhance the User Interface(UI) and make the user stay in the ecosystem. As our future enhancements, we are planning to embed our app with other food ordering applications(Uber Eats, Swiggy, Dominos pizza, etc.).
